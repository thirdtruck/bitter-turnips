Better late than never! Wishing I'd started this from minute one of the game jam but there's still plenty to talk about.

`slotmap` provides support for multiple key types, in order to support stronger type checks between its maps. I'll try adding a `VillagerKey` and see how well that works.

Never mind! All the maps I have right now actually need the same key. I'll revisit this later, like if/when I had a reverse look-up table for coordinates.
